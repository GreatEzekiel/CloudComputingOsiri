Project: Comparative Analysis of 18 ML Models for Stock Forecasting

Author: GREAT EZEKIEL

Submission Date: January 15, 2026

📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict stock transaction types (BUY vs. SELL) using historical Yahoo Finance data. It evaluates 18 distinct algorithms to identify the most robust model for financial time-series classification, culminating in a cloud-deployed web application.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
1. Data Source & Preprocessing
Dataset: Yahoo Finance Historical Transaction Data.

Features used: amount, reportedPrice, usdValue.

Handling Imbalance: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the BUY/SELL classes, ensuring the model doesn't favor the majority class.

Scaling: Utilized StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions.

2. Algorithmic Rigor
The research compared 18 models across multiple categories:

Linear: Logistic Regression, Ridge, Lasso.

Tree-Based: Decision Trees, Extra Trees (Best Model), Random Forest.

Boosting: XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM.

Probabilistic/Other: Naïve Bayes, SVM, k-NN, MLP Neural Networks.

The Winner: The Extra Trees Classifier achieved a validation accuracy of ~72.47%, outperforming others in handling the high variance of financial data.

3. Cloud Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Frontend/UI: Streamlit

Model Hosting: Streamlit Community Cloud

Version Control: GitHub
